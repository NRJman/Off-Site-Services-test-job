## Synopsis

This is an "Off-Site Services test job" repository. There are two completed tasks here. The first one is a layout task. I had a page layout and I needed to write the same one on HTML/CSS/JS. The second one is a form validation task. I needed to write a validation for the form I had.

## Motivation

This is a test job for one of companies. I liked it and it was interesting for me to do it, because it's like a new challenge for me.
